# PaytmProjTurbo

## Overview

**PaytmProjTurbo** is a full-stack financial transaction system designed to facilitate peer-to-peer (P2P) money transfers, on-ramp transactions, and user balance management. The project leverages a monorepo architecture using **Turborepo**, integrating multiple applications and packages to deliver a cohesive financial platform. It uses **Next.js** for both frontend and backend, and an **Express.js-based bank webhook** to handle transactions.

## Features

- **Secure Authentication:** Uses NextAuth to handle secure user login and session management.
- **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Transfers:** Seamlessly transfer money between users with real-time updates.
- **On-Ramp Transactions:** Load money into the user's account via integrated banking APIs.
- **Transaction History:** View a list of all sent and received transactions, including timestamps and statuses.
- **Express Webhook Handling:** Uses an Express.js server to listen to bank transaction updates and process them efficiently.
- **User Balance Management:** View and manage the current balance and locked funds.
- **Efficient Monorepo Structure:** Uses Turborepo for managing apps and packages under one unified project.
- **Robust CI/CD Pipelines:** Automates build and deployment processes using GitHub Actions and Docker.
- **Dockerized Deployment:** Seamless deployment with Docker and EC2 integration for scalability and reliability.

- **User Authentication:** Secure login system using NextAuth.
- **P2P Money Transfer:** Enables users to send and receive funds seamlessly.
- **On-Ramp Transactions:** Allows users to load funds into their accounts via integrated banking APIs.
- **Transaction History:** Provides a comprehensive view of all past transactions with real-time status updates.
